      <h2>Schedule Mode</h2>
      <p>
        Schedule mode determines which action buttons are available in the
        notification window before your device hibernates.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Strict Mode</strong> – No optional buttons. Your device will
          hibernate automatically based on the schedule.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Moderate Mode</strong> – You can snooze hibernation, but you
          cannot cancel it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flexible Mode</strong> – You can either snooze or cancel
          hibernation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        Snoozing hibernation extends the schedule by 5 minutes only. Hibernation
        will occur automatically after 3 snoozes.

      <h2>Enabling / Disabling Schedule</h2>
      <p>
        You can enable or disable a schedule by clicking the checkbox on the
        schedule card.
      </p>
      <p>
        Disabling a schedule pauses its hibernation task until it is enabled
        again, as long as the scheduled time period has not already passed.

            <em><b>A boot schedule</b> </em> defines when you are allowed to use
            your device. Outside of this time window, the device will not remain
            active. <br />
            <br />
            <em><b>A hibernate schedule</b></em> determines when your device
            will automatically hibernate (turn off) based on the configured
            schedule.

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            You control how long your device remains hibernated by setting a
            boot schedule for that day. Once configured, you can choose
            <em>Hibernate Now</em> to apply it immediately.

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Depending on the selected schedule mode, you may be able to snooze
            or cancel the hibernation. In Strict Mode, no action is available
            and hibernation will proceed automatically.
